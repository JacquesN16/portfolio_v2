  "aboutContent": "On 2021, I decided to try my hand at hacking some neighbor's Wi-Fi and tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of building software for two start-up and take some first steps in this long journey.\n\nMy main focus these days is building products and prototypes for our clients at Kadow.club. In my free time, I've created some 2d roguelike game to fullfill my childhood dream.When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually hanging out with my wife and my daughter, or running around."
